# Managing Memories

Chanakya's ability to remember information across conversations is a key feature that allows for a personalized experience. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to manage the assistant's long-term memory.

## Accessing the Memory Management Page

You can access the memory management interface by clicking the **Manage Memories** (ðŸ§ ) button located in the top-right corner of the main application window.

This will take you to a dedicated page where you can view, add, and delete the information that Chanakya stores.

## How Memory Works

Chanakya's long-term memory is a collection of simple facts or statements. When you ask a question, the agent searches this memory for relevant information to include in its response.

For example, if you save the memory "The user's favorite color is blue," you can later ask, "What's my favorite color?" and Chanakya will be able to answer correctly.

## Operations

### Viewing Memories

All existing memories are displayed in a list on the Memory Management page. You can scroll through this list to see everything Chanakya has stored.

### Adding a New Memory

1.  Locate the text input box at the top of the page.
2.  Type the new fact or piece of information you want to save. For example: `My office is in the city center.`
3.  Click the **"Add Memory"** button.
4.  The new memory will appear in the list below.

### Deleting a Memory

1.  Find the memory you wish to remove from the list.
2.  Click the **"Delete"** button next to that specific memory.
3.  The memory will be permanently removed from the database.

## Tips for Effective Memory Management

-   **Be Atomic:** Store small, individual pieces of information. Instead of a long paragraph, break it down into single-sentence facts.
    -   **Good:** `My name is John Doe.`
    -   **Good:** `I live in New York.`
    -   **Bad:** `My name is John Doe and I live in New York.`
-   **Be Clear and Direct:** Write memories in simple, unambiguous language. The clearer the statement, the more likely the assistant is to use it correctly.
-   **Review Periodically:** Occasionally review the list of memories to remove outdated or irrelevant information. This helps keep the assistant's knowledge base accurate.
-   **Personalize Your Assistant:** Add key personal details to get highly personalized responses. For example:
    -   The user's name, location, or profession.
    -   Important dates like birthdays or anniversaries.
    -   Preferences, such as "The user prefers concise answers."
    -   Information about medications, allergies, or daily routines.

By curating Chanakya's long-term memory, you can transform it from a generic assistant into a powerful tool that is truly tailored to your needs.
